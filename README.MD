# Adding support of node migration for multimode mininet setup with config

## Task:
1. Have at least 3 FRR routers in a cluster (2 routers on one server and one on another)<br/>
2. Verify connectivity between all routers<br/>
3. Do some runtime configuration on the routers. (IP, files, etc.)<br/>
4. Migrate one router from the server with two routers to another server.<br/>
5. Verify connectivity.<br/>
6. Do configuration in a way that 2 additional hosts wonâ€™t lose connectivity during node migration.<br/>


## Topology:

## Other notes:

* There are two files topo1.py and topo2.py for two parts of topology

* To add internet to Mininet: `sudo dhclient eth1`

* Add l2tp tunnel: `sudo ip l2tp add tunnel tunnel_id 1000 peer_tunnel_id 1000 encap udp local <LOCAL_IP> remote <REMOTE_IP> udp_sport 60000 udp_dport 60000`
* Add session: `sudo ip l2tp add session name eth12 tunnel_id 1000 session_id 2000 peer_session_id 2000`
